<h1>Pokecard - A Discord.js bot developed for the All Things Pokemon Disocrd server to search pokemon cards!</h1>
<h6>Pokecard is a discord.js (master version) bot built for the "All Things Pokemon" Discord server. The bot uses a pokemon API to search for pokemon cards, so users can build their decks and find cards they are missing in a set! The project has been slowly developed and unfinished due to Retr0n, my public Discord bot, having a very big update that i've been working on. The projects only command currently is `p!search <pokemon>`, and it will output a list of pokemon cards with their card ID, and a link to veiw an image of the card! This project is far from finished, and will be continued very soon! The bot uses the newest version of my Discord.js command and event handlers, witch both process comand and event files very efficiently! If you would like to contribute to the project, please make a pull request or issue! Also, feel free to use any source code with the API if your project, but please credit me as a contributer! Happy developing :)</h6>
